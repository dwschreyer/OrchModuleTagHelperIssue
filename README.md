# OrchModuleTagHelperIssue

I attempted a project as per the demo by [SÃ©bastian Ros on On.NET](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/Sbastien-Ros-Modular-ASPNET-apps). Great demo and works well.

The AsModule feature is a great solutions for allowing different development teams within an organisation to plug features into a base solution. 

My objectives with this project is to investigate if:

- TagHelpers can be shared between modules.
- Services (E.g. Repositories) can be shared between modules.
- Base controllers can be shared between modules.

So far I am able to share services and base controllers.

However, it seems that when TagHelpers are defined in an external assembly they do not work with AsModule projects. If the TagHelper is defined in the AsModule project it works fine.

This issue is currently being tracked here: https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard2/issues/696

Roadmap:

- Base views
- Project templates
- Settings on a per module basis`
- Real world demo application
- Guidance documentation
